## The brief - Mood boards
    
To kick off the design process, each team member should create a mood board to collate influences and ideas for their design. The influences may be digital or physical and might include elements such as colour and typography.
    
Read the article [20 pro tips for creating inspirational mood boards](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470) before starting.
    
You can create your mood board any way that suits, PhotoShop, PowerPoint or even a physical item.
    
Note that each group member will add their mood board to the slides for the SP3 presentation. You will be able to amended them following feedback, if required.
    
For this submission add all of your mood boards to a single PDF file.
    
### Output

Format - pdf file. Filename - `mood_board.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your moodboards will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. They are marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Parallel Designs
    
### What is this?
    
This technique involves each team member creating an initial design for your group’s web site. Each person works independently, and when finished, shares his/her concepts with the team. The team then considers each solution, and each member uses the best ideas to further improve their own solution.
    
“This process helps to generate many different, diverse ideas and ensures that the best ideas from each design are integrated into the final site design. What is most striking about parallel design is how many ideas can be considered in a very short time period.”_ [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/parallel-design.html)
    
### Steps to take:
    
1. Each team member must work independently on his/her own design concept for your website. Your design may address issues such as layout, space, form, colour, typography whilst always considering usability and accessibility. Consider your design from a ‘mobile first’ perspective.
1. Your design concept can be created as hi-fi or low-fi using the various techniques explained in class. These techniques include a composition (comp) created in Photoshop, a low-fi HTML/CSS wireframe (perhaps using a grid system) or a mock-up using Axure or Balsamiq etc. You can use [dummy text and images](https://contentsnare.com/dummy-text-image-generators/) as placeholders.  

**Tip:** *Be creative, but keep it realistic. After all, you’ve got to build this at some point. It also has to be both accessible and useable*.

1. Once completed the team should get together and share their design concepts and other ideas. Following this meeting each member should review his/her own design to make amendments and improvements.
1. The team should then meet for a final time to agree which elements from the individual designs will be used to create the team's _final design_.
1. The last task for the team is to create a _final design_ (mobile and desktop). This is the design you intend to take forward into the build process.
    
### Try this on your final design
    
**The 5-second test:** Show a number of people the _final design_ for 5 seconds (or for another short period of time). This approach is best for accurately capturing people’s ‘gut reaction.’ 5 seconds of viewing time is too short for reading copy or for noticing details like specific fonts or colors, but it is enough for forming an impression which accurately reflects the visual style. Read more about [testing visual design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/testing-visual-design/).
    
Record their comments, discuss as a group - do they love your design? Have they spotted something that needs changing?
    
### For SP3
    
Each group member will add their design plus the group's _final design_ to the slides for the SP3 presentation. You will be able to amended them following feedback, if required.
    
### Output

Format - pdf file. Filename - `parallel_designs.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your designs will be reviewed as part of the SP3 presentation. They are marked at SP5.*

### For SP5
    
For the final submission (SP5) add all of your individual designs, plus the group's *final design* to a single PDF file.

## The brief - Live Style Guide
    
You know what a style guide is. You know how to create one.
    
Now create a style guide for the project web site - the Guide. Use colour, typography and media that best represents the brand of your guide (not your team).
    
Obviously this guide should be different to the guide for your team web site. Use the same [template style_guide.html](../../raw/master/templates/template_style_guide.zip).
    
### Output

Format - html file. Filename - `style_guide.html`. Save the relevant files and folders to the styleguide folder that sits inside the `docs` folder.

*Your style guide will be reviewed as part of the SP3 presentation. It is marked at SP5.*

# THE BRIEF - A Guide to Manchester

Your tutors are acting as the client - in this scenario they are representing Manchester Metropolitan University.

## Overview

Manchester Metropolitan University are employing a number of digital agencies (your teams) to create a variety of topic-specific guides to Greater Manchester for students, their friends and families.

Each team should select a topic/focus for the guide they are to create. Examples might include: sports clubs, sports venues, statues, museums, art galleries, coffee shops, restaurants, nightclubs, parks, architecture etc.

You will develop an initial idea for your 'guide' in the early stages of the project. This will be agreed with the client and defined in the proposal document. The proposal helps the client and agency define and agree on what is to be built.

## Key requirements:

-  A modern, attractive website - 25 web pages, a minimum of 10.

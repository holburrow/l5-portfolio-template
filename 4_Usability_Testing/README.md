## Instructions

### About
    
Submission Point 4 is a chance for your group to conduct a usability testing session under instruction. You will be required to attend your designated session fully prepared as instructed.
    
You have now reached the stage where you have a basic design, content and structure for your group’s web site. The group is now required to carry out a recorded Usability Testing session. This is a chance to test out your design on a ‘user’ and to get feedback on the success or failures of your current version.

Feedback from someone outside of your team can be invaluable to improve your work. It may highlight errors or inconsistencies; it may raise issues you had not previously noted. It might also confirm that you are doing (at least some) things right.
    
### Essential Documents
    
- [Usability Test Instructions](../../raw/master/support/sp4_usability_test_instructions.docx).
    
- [Usability Test tips & advice](../../raw/master/support/sp4_usability_testing_tips.docx).
    
### On the day
    
Each team will have a scheduled session on the day. Bring with you the following:
    
1.  The script
1.  Consent form
1.  Exit survey
    
The group will need to decide what role each group member undertakes for the test session. Someone needs to lead the session. You need note takers, someone looking after the candidate and someone in charge of the tech.
    
Your web site needs to be accessible on the web, ready to test.
    
### Assessment
    
You will be assessed on your preparation and execution of the usability testing session (as per the [marking schedule](../../raw/master/support/sp4-marksheet.docx) ). A tutor will support you.
    
### Marks
    
SP4 is worth 5% of the overall mark for Assessment One.

1.  The tasks (see instructions)
1.  Have some ‘spare tasks’
1.  Thank you
1.  ‘We have an exit survey’
    
Use the [test script template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_test_script.docx). Amend and print for the test session.

## (Post test) exit survey

The survey should be given to the test candidate (in paper form) at the end of the test session. Ask them to leave the room and to complete the survey before they leave.

Use the results from the survey as part of your *Usability test session conclusions* document.

# Usability Testing

## Submission Point Four

<p>In SP4 each team undertakes a usability testing session, self-managed, but overseen by tutors.</p>

<p>The output is a report produced for SP5</p>

**First - [Read through the instructions](#instructions)**

* [SP4 planning document](#SP4-planning-document)
* [Your test script](#test-script)
* [User testing consent form](#consent-form)
* [Usability testing report](#usability-testing-report)


## Instructions

### About
    
Submission Point 4 is a chance for your team to conduct a usability testing session under instruction. You will be required to attend your designated session fully prepared as instructed.
    
You have now reached the stage where you have a basic design, content and structure for your `guide` web site. The group is now required to carry out a recorded Usability Testing session. This is a chance to test out your design on a ‘user’ and to get feedback on the success or failures of your current version.

Feedback from someone outside of your team can be invaluable to improve your work. It may highlight errors or inconsistencies; it may raise issues you had not previously noted. It might also confirm that you are doing (at least some) things right.
    
### Essential Documents
    
- [Usability Test Instructions](ux-testing/usability_test_instructions.md).
    
- [Usability Test tips & advice](ux-testing/usability_testing_tips.md).
    
### On the day
    
Each team will have a scheduled session on the day. Bring with you the following:
    
1.  The script
1.  Consent form
1.  Exit survey
    
The group will need to decide what role each group member undertakes for the test session. Someone needs to lead the session. You need note takers, someone looking after the candidate and someone in charge of the tech.
    
Your web site needs to be accessible on the web, ready to test.
    
### Assessment
    
You will be assessed on your preparation and execution of the usability testing session (as per the [marking schedule](marksheets/sp4-marksheet.docx) ). A tutor will support you.

## SP3 Planning document

Use the planning document to prepare and record the meeting.

>Document: [sp4-planning.md](sp4-planning.md)

## The brief - User testing script
    
You are required to develop a script for your test session. This will act as a prompt and help you run the session.
    
Your script should contain the following elements. These will be discussed in class.
    
1.  Welcome
1.  Why you are doing the testing
1.  Not ‘testing you’
1.  Explain 'think aloud'
1.  The tasks (see instructions)
1.  Have some ‘spare tasks’
1.  Thank you
1.  ‘We have an exit survey’
    
>Document: [test script template document](test_script.md). Amend and print for the test session.
    
*You will use the script during your test session. Ensure a copy is in place here for assessment at SP5*.

## Usability testing consent form

Customise the consent form (provided) for your test candidate to sign. This should include permission to record the session including video, audio and their actions on screen.

>Document: [consent form template document](ux-testing/consent_form.md). Amend and print for the test session.

After the test session scan the signed document to `jpg`. This will be added to [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

---

## (Post test) exit survey

Create a simple exit survey (5 or 6 questions) to get further feedback from your test candidate. 

The survey should be given to the test candidate (in paper form) at the end of the test session. Ask them to leave the room and to complete the survey before they leave.

Use the results from the survey as part of your report. After the test session scan the signed document to `pdf`. Add to [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

---
 
## Notes
    
During the test session one or more members of the group should be taking notes. After the session, you can review the video to make further notes.

Use the [MSWord Mini User Journey](UX-testing/Mini-User-Journey.docx) form to record your notes/observations during your usability testing session (and any subsequent sessions).

This form provides structure to your note taking. Prepare for the session:

- Create a version of this form for each of your core tasks tasks (after the general walk through),entering the steps you expect the user to take, to attain their goal.

- Print a number of copies of each task for the note takers.

Note takers should complete the form, making notes of their observations during the session.

>When completed, scan the notes to a single `pdf` document and add to the [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

## Test session video
    
We will capture the test session for you (screen, voice and face). After the sessions we will process the videos and make them available on Moodle for you review.

Reviewing the video will help you better understand the results of your testing.

You can use screenshots from the video as part of your [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

## Usability Testing Report
    
Using the template provided to develop a report on the test session and any further testing carried out during the project.

Any good UX report should answer the following questions:

1. What did you do?
1. Why did you do it?
1. How did you do it?
1. What did you find?
1. What are you going to do about it (ie how will it be brought back into the design/process)?

**All further testing should be detailed, evidenced (photographs) and include signed consent forms for any further test candidates**.
    
Always make clear any issues (support with images, screenshots etc). Provide solutions, illustrate changes. Test the changes (if you can).

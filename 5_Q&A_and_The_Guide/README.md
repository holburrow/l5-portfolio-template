    - [Download - SP5 The Portfolio - Marksheet](../../raw/master/support/sp5-portfolio-marksheet.docx) 

## Final items

All of your documents (including those below) are delivered via the portfolio page of a final version of your team website. Use the parotfolio marksheet to ensure you have all of the required documents in place before submission.

## Testing the site to ensure quality

Quality assurance is essential for any finished product. In the 'real world' you don't want to be releasing a product (website) that contains errors and omissions. 

As a student, to maximise the potential for a good mark you need to:

- Ensure the project fulfils the requirements of the brief (by checking against the brief and marksheet).
- By testing the final 'live' site before submission using the tools and techniques listed below.

## The brief - Accessibility audit
    
The WebAIM WCAG 2 checklist helps you undertake an audit of your siteâ€™s accessibility (using the accessibility guidelines).
    
Three documents are provided.
    
- Use the [WebAIM WCAG 2 checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/WCAG2Checklist.pdf) to assess your site. Print a copy and tick or cross relevant boxes.
    
- Use the [WebAIM WCAG 2 support document](../../raw/master/support/WCAG2_checklist_support.docx) to help you understand the checklist and what is relevant to your project.
    
- Use the [WCAG comments document](../../raw/master/templates/template_WCAG2_comments.docx) to record any issues addressed and actions taken. This document provides tutors with an insight into how you have managed the audit.

### Core accessibility issues for your submission:
    
1.  Use of semantic elements for page structure
1.  Colour contrast
1.  Alt text for images
1.  Skip links implemented
1.  Accessible form(s)

### Output

Create a single document containing your completed checklist and comments document. Format - pdf file. Filename - `accessibility.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - Cross Browser testing
    
You must check your guide using a variety of browsers across a variety of devices to test browser compatibility. This means different browsers, versions, operating systems and screen sizes.
    
You could use a free trial of [www.browserstack.com](http://www.browserstack.com/) \- one of the most popular tools at the moment for cross browser testing. However you can also create screenshots from the variety of browsers available at MMU on the Macs, PCs and iPads. You can also use your personal laptops and mobile devices.
    
Copy the screenshots to the template provided and add comments regarding any findings, errors or corrections. 

Illustrate any corrections - if you've spotted an error, fix it, re-test, screenshot, comment.
    
Use the [browser testing template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_browser_testing.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `browser_testing.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - Usability testing report
    
It is presumed that you will be undertaking further testing after the SP4 test session as your site evolves. In fact you may have done earlier test sessions on prototypes etc.

Write a summary report detailing your experience of usability testing during this project and what the team learnt, changes implemented etc. Illustrate with relevant screenshots.
    
Discuss and provide evidence of any test sessions beyond the SP4 session.

**Please note**: Any further test sessions should be managed in a similar way with test candidates signing a consent form and being informed of their rights. Include copies of any additional consent forms with this report.

500 words (+/- 10%).
    
Use the [usability report template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_usability_report.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `usability_report.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - Google translation testing report
    
Internationalisation (l18n) is when we take a website and modify it for another audience speaking a different language. If your website was translated into another language, would the layout cope? Some languages have really long words: Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften (google it) for example. Do you have text 'locked away' in images that can't be translated? What happens when your browser has to show text with a different alphabet?
    
We would like you to run your site through google translate (using the chrome browser plugin) and check that a visitor from another country would be able to use your site in their language. We'd suggest German, Russian and Chinese as a start - if one of your team members can speak another language please use their expertise and test the site in their language (how good a job does google translate do?). If your site has a form, check this list of falsehoods - are you assuming anything about your users you shouldn't?
    
Put together a short report with screenshots (250 words) of three translated versions of the homepage and an inner page of your site, and talk about any issues you found as a result.
    
Use the [report template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_internationalisation.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `internationalisation.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - Quality audit
    
Test for quality. This includes html validation, coding, links, seo and metadata.
    
Undertake a speed test using one or more of the online tools. Identify and fix any overs-sized images (prime cause of slow loading).
    
Validate and audit your CSS (looking for unused, redundant CSS)

#### Tools to use
    
1.  [Checkbot - Chrome extension](https://www.checkbot.io)
1.  [Google Test my site](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com)
1.  [HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
1.  [CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    
Develop a short report using selected screenshots to provide evidence. Discuss any issues discovered and how they were tackled.
    
Use the [report template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_quality_audit.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `quality_audit.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - Future developments
    
A single team statement on possible ways the site could be further developed for the client in the future.
    
250 words (+/- 10%)
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `future.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - Sprint sheets
    
Sprint sheets are used to record three things:
    
1.  What are you going to work on over the coming week?
1.  Who in the team is going to do what?
1.  Group health - is everyone engaged with the project?
    
Most weeks tutors will review your sprint sheets as part of the sprint meeting. We will review the previous sprint sheet - did you achieve what you planned to do? We will discuss the new sprint sheet - what are you planning to do?
    
Use the [Sprint sheet template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_sprint_sheets.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `sprint_sheets.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

---

## The brief - Peer assessment

Printed copies of the forms will be supplied in class. They can also be downloaded - [peer assessment template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_peer_assessment.docx).
    
### Output

You are required to print, complete, sign and scan the documents for SP5.

Format - docx file. Filename - `peer_assessment.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - Individual statement
    
This is a chance to discuss how you and your colleagues managed the project, what you learnt plus your individual critique of the final product.
    
As this statement is personal you are not required to display this as part of the Portfolio. Each statement is submitted to an individual dropbox on Moodle.
    
500 words (+/- 10%).
    
Use the [template document for your individual statement](../../raw/master/templates/template_individual_statement.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `individual_statement.docx`. 

**Moodle** - Each team member must upload their individual statement the the relevant dropbox on Moodle.
    
## Marks

SP5 is worth 80% of the overall mark for Assessment One. This is divided 40% for the Guide project website and 40% for the Team website (including the portfolio of supporting documents). See marksheets for details.

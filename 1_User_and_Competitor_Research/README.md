## Ideation Report

    
Initial ideas - You will be introduced in class to a variety of ideation techniques, allowing the team to 'brainstorm' and define a number of initial ideas for the project web site (the Guide).
    
Write a short (300 word max) outlining your ideation process and the techniques used.

Scan any resulting documents (photograph if too big) and save as .jpg files in the `sp1-media` folder.

Insert these images, provide captions to illustrate your ideation sessions.

>Document: [ideation.md](ideation.md)

*Your ideation will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

## User Research Report

User Research - Undertake some initial user research with friends, family and fellow students to better understand what people would want from the guide you are proposing. Use the document provided which is based on a BBC User Research document.

Each team member should develop 2 or 3 user profiles. Note - these are not Personas (developed later). These should be based on real people.

You are trying to get the thoughts of 'real' people about the type of product you are about to build (and their experience of similar products).
    
>Document: [user-research.md](user-research.md)

*Your user research will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

## The Proposal
    
Project Proposal - You are required to create a Proposal (1000 words) that provides brief details of the web site you plan to construct. The client briefing and user research will help inform this document. 

The proposal becomes an agreement between your team and the client about vision and direction of the Guide.

>Document: [proposal.md](proposal.md)

*Your proposal will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

## Competitor Analysis
    
Competitor Analysis Report - As a team, you are required to review 3 web sites that are similar to the type of site you are building â€“ a guide. These sites may be local, UK-based or overseas (if relevant).
    
You could for example look at any direct, local competitor guides, guides for other cities, examples of good guides (on any topic), and perhaps like guides that are part of larger sites. 

**Avoid Trip Advisor**. 

Analyse the 3 sites using the criteria on the Competitor Analysis document provided.

**The Competitor Analysis document is too complex for Markdown and is therefore supplied as an MSword document.**

>Document: [competitor-analysis.docx ](competitor-analysis.docx) provided.
    
*Your competitor analysis will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

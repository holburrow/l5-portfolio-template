The following documents should be presented. Note that they are not being assessed. This is a chance to get formative feedback on your progress.

Final versions of these documents are assessed at the final submission.

- SP1 planning document
- Ideation Report
- User Research Report
- The Proposal
- Competitor Analysis

## SP1 planning document
## Ideation Report

    
Initial ideas - You will be introduced in class to a variety of ideation techniques, allowing the team to 'brainstorm' and define a number of initial ideas for the project web site (the Guide).
    
### Output

Scan any resulting documents (photograph if too big) and save as a single pdf file. Filename - `ideation.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*This document will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. It is marked at SP5.*

- The above indicates that we will mark the final version of this document at Submission Point 5. 
    
- At Submission Point 2 we will review the current version of your documents and provide feedback and guidance. 
    
- You should take the opportunity after SP2 to use our feedback to improve your submission.

- Use subsequent sprint meetings to show us revised versions.

- Of course you may have got it right first time! Job done.

## User Research Report

User Research - Undertake some initial user research with friends, family and fellow students to better understand what people would want from the guide you are proposing. Use the [BBC User Research template](../../raw/master/templates/template_user_research.docx) document.
    
Each team member should develop 2 or 3 user profiles. Note - these are not Personas (developed later). These should be based on real people.

You are trying to get the thoughts of 'real' people about the type of product you are about to build (and their experience of similar products).
    
### Output

Save as a single docx file. Filename - `user_research.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your user research will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. It is marked at SP5.*

## The Proposal
    
Project Proposal - You are required to create a Proposal (1000 words) that provides brief details of the web site you plan to construct. The client briefing and user research will help inform this document. 

The proposal becomes an agreement between your team and the client about vision and direction of the Guide.

Use the [Proposal template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_proposal.docx) provided.
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `proposal.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your proposal will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. It is marked at SP5.*

## Competitor Analysis
    
Competitor Analysis Report - As a team, you are required to review 3 web sites that are similar to the type of site you are building â€“ a guide. These sites may be local, UK-based or overseas (if relevant).
    
You could for example look at any direct, local competitor guides, guides for other cities, examples of good guides (on any topic), and perhaps like guides that are part of larger sites. Avoid Trip Advisor. Analyse the 3 sites using the criteria on the [Competitor Analysis template](../../raw/master/templates/template_competitor_analysis.docx) provided.
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `competitor_analysis.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your competitor analysis will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2 Presentation. It is marked at SP5.*

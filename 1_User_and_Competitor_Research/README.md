# User &amp; Competitor Research

## Submission Point One
SP1 is an assessed team meeting with tutors. Use the planning document as a guide. Marks are awarded for attendance, engagement and preparedness.

The following documents should be presented. Note that they are not being assessed. This is a chance to get formative feedback on your progress.

>These documents are assessed at the final submission.

- [SP1 planning document](#sp1-planning-document)
- [Ideation Report](#Ideation-Report)
- [User Research Report](#User-Research-Report)
- [The Proposal](#The-Proposal)
- [Competitor Analysis](#Competitor-Analysis)
- [Personas](#personas)
- [User Storyboards](#user-storyboards)

First, a few words about our use of Markdown and GitHub.

## Markdown

Most of the documents we are asking you to develop are in Markdown.

>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

Markdown is one of those *little* skills you should have. It's also fun and easy to use. You can open and create `.md` documents in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown). Preview mode allows you to edit and view a document in your editor.

### Markdown Cheatsheet

[Adam Pritchard's Markdown Cheatsheet on GitHub](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) has all you need to get started. He also links to some more detailed resources.

## Version Control

### Git

>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

Using Git allows your team to manage both your documents and code for this assignment. Correctly used, version control allows multiple users to contribute to (or comment on) the same document (although this can get complicated). It also allows you to recover previous versions. Instructions and advice for use will be given in class.

### GitHub

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/)

GitHub is one of those things you *just need to know* in digital. It can be complex. Teams can decide what level of use they want to make of GitHub throughout the project.

>We recommend you use GitHub to co-operate on documents rather than to *work on at the same time*.

Used correctly, making use of GitHub at the very least ensures all of your work is backed up.

>**Final word** - GitHub provides tutors (and team members) an unparalleled insight into the contributions of each team member.

## SP1 planning document

Use the planning document to prepare and record the meeting.

>Document: [sp1-planning.md](sp1-planning.md)

*This document will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

- The above indicates that we will mark the final version of this document at Submission Point 5. 
    
- At Submission Point 1 we will review the current version of your documents and provide feedback and guidance. 
    
- You should take the opportunity after SP1 to use our feedback to improve your submission.

- Use subsequent sprint meetings to show us revised versions.

- Of course you may have got it right first time! Job done.

## Ideation Report

    
Initial ideas - You will be introduced in class to a variety of ideation techniques, allowing the team to 'brainstorm' and define a number of initial ideas for the project web site (the Guide).
    
Write a short (300 word max) outlining your ideation process and the techniques used.

Scan any resulting documents (photograph if too big) and save as .jpg files in the `sp1-media` folder.

Insert these images, provide captions to illustrate your ideation sessions.

>Document: [ideation.md](ideation.md)

*Your ideation will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

---

## User Research Report

User Research - Undertake some initial user research with friends, family and fellow students to better understand what people would want from the guide you are proposing. Use the document provided which is based on a BBC User Research document.

Each team member should develop 2 or 3 user profiles. Note - these are not Personas (developed later). These should be based on real people.

You are trying to get the thoughts of 'real' people about the type of product you are about to build (and their experience of similar products).
    
>Document: [user-research.md](user-research.md)

*Your user research will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

---

## The Proposal
    
Project Proposal - You are required to create a Proposal (1000 words) that provides brief details of the web site you plan to construct. The client briefing and user research will help inform this document. 

The proposal becomes an agreement between your team and the client about vision and direction of the Guide.

>Document: [proposal.md](proposal.md)

*Your proposal will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

## Competitor Analysis
    
Competitor Analysis Report - As a team, you are required to review 3 web sites that are similar to the type of site you are building â€“ a guide. These sites may be local, UK-based or overseas (if relevant).
    
You could for example look at any direct, local competitor guides, guides for other cities, examples of good guides (on any topic), and perhaps like guides that are part of larger sites. 

**Avoid Trip Advisor**. 

Analyse the 3 sites using the criteria on the Competitor Analysis document provided.

**The Competitor Analysis document is too complex for Markdown and is therefore supplied as an MSword document.**

>Document: [competitor-analysis.docx ](competitor-analysis.docx) provided.
    
*Your competitor analysis will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

---

## Personas
    
User Personas - Create 3 user personas based on the user types your research indicates you might expect to use your guide.
    
One must be an international visitor to your site. Maybe one disabled but this must be based on your research not a guess.
    
We prefer you to be creative and develop your own personas over using a template site. If you use a template make sure you customise the output.

### Instructions:

- Output each of your personas as .jpg or .png files
- Ensure the files are at least 1900px wide
- Save to the sp2-media folder
- Embed each persona image (using the code provided) in `personas.md`

>Document: [personas.md](personas.md)

*Your personas will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. They are marked at SP5.*

## User Storyboards

>STORYBOARDING, a technique used in the film-making industry, is a way of conveying a story to teams and stakeholders, as well as a way to explore the best way to tell the story visually before spending a lot of money producing it. [Bryant Hodson](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-storyboard-experiences-fc051e2bc04d)

Create a simple storyboard (6 or 8 cells) for each of your personas. Illustrate how they might each interact with your guide. This could be an illustration of their touch points and interactions with your guide throughout the day, or perhaps during a term.

This will help the team think about how your users are going to use and interact with your guide.

by Rachel Krause ](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/storyboards-visualize-ideas/).

Rachel also has a video - [How to Create a UX Storyboard](https://youtu.be/bNh54LNUtv8).

### Instructions:

- Create your persona on paper or digitally depending on your skills. It does not be high fidelity.
- The above article includes a template you can print, or shows how post-its can be used in a collaborative manner.
- Add captions to each frame.
- If on paper, scan rather than photograph for better results.
- Output each of your storyboards as .jpg or .png files
- Ensure the files are at least 1900px wide
- Save to the sp2-media folder
- Embed each storyboard image (using the code provided) in `storyboards.md`

>Document: [storyboards.md](storyboards.md)

*Your storyboards will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. They are marked at SP5.*

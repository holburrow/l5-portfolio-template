## The brief - Personas
    
User Personas - Create 3 user personas based on the user types your research indicates you might expect to use your guide.
    
One must be an international visitor to your site. Maybe one disabled but this must be based on your research not a guess.
    
We prefer you to be creative and develop your own personas over using a template site. If you use a template make sure you customise the output.
    
### Output

Format - pdf file. Filename - `personas.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your personas will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. They are marked at SP5.*

## The brief - User Journeys
    
User Journey Mapping - **Develop a user journey for each persona**. Explore what type of interaction(s) these users might typically have with the site. Read the article [When and How to Create Customer Journey Maps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customer-journey-mapping/).
    
Use the [User Journey template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_user_journey.pptx) we have created from [Paul Boag's article](https://boagworld.com/usability/customer-journey-mapping/).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `user_journey.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*A sample user journey will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. They all are marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Information Architecture
    
Information Architecture Report - The team must carry out and record an open card sort and tree jacking exercise to inform your initial site architecture. This will be illustrated as a site plan.
    
Write a short (500 words) illustrated report on the process and results.
    
Use the [report template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_ia_report.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `ia_report.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Not required for the SP2 Presentation. It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Site Plan
    
Site Plan - This is an illustration of your recommended architecture for the new site based on the findings of your card sorting exercise. You MUST use the formatting illustrated in class. By the end of the project you may have a number of iterations of this plan due to changes as you progress with the project.
    
Use the [site plan template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_site_plan.pptx).
    
You can use the tools in PowerPoint to create a simple tree structure.
    
### Output

Format - pptx file. Filename - `site_plan.pptx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your initial site plan will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. It is marked at SP5.*

## Database schema

### AWDD Students only

Your site needs to hold some of its content in a database – news items, list of events, public artwork names and locations, local cheese varieties, etc etc. You need to think about which ‘fields’ your database will need and what sort of information they would contain. We also need you to create a sketch in code or on paper of how these database fields will be shown on the site on a ‘list page’ and a ‘detail’ page – e.g. the ‘list page’ would list all the cheeses, and the detail page would have all the information about one type of cheese – what does it look like, where can I buy it, who makes it, etc.

### Output

Bring your schema ideas to the presentation to discuss with tutors. Any output can be then scanned and saved as a pdf.

Format - pdf file. Filename - `schema.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - Content Delivery Schedule
    
An essential part of the development of your site is to decide on the content of each page. As a team, you then need to decide where the content, which may include text, images, links (and metadata if you really want to get ahead), is going to come from. This means agreeing and charting what is required and who is responsible for either gathering or creating each item.
    
The actual building process of your site will be both speedier and easier if you have all the relevant materials ready prior to the final construction phase.
    
Create a a team repository for all the site content. Set up a procedure for proofing copy and optimising media.
    
You are required to use the [Content Schedule template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_content_schedule.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `content_schedule.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your content delivery schedule will be reviewed at SP3. It is marked at SP5.*
